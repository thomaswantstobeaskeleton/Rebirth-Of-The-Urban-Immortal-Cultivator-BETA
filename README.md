A browser-based open-world RPG set in the **Rebirth of the Urban Immortal Cultivator** (重生之都市修仙) universe. You play as a **newly awakened cultivator** in a modern city—not the original prose protagonist. Choose your name, background, and avatar, then explore a metropolis where spiritual qi, martial sects, ancient relics, and cosmic stakes hide beneath the urban surface.

## Macro-structure (same as the novel)

- **The game begins entirely on Earth.** Early gameplay is confined to modern urban environments (Chuzhou downtown, night markets, corporate towers, alleyways).
- **Hidden cultivation societies** (Kunlun, North Qiong, Pill Refining Hall, Dark Witch Hall, Heaven's Kill, Green Gang) and **spiritual zones** (qi vein tunnels, ancient temples, rooftop relics) exist beneath the surface of normal society.
- **Early cultivation realms and conflicts** mirror the Earth-stage progression: Foundation Establishment → Profound Connection → Spirit Sea → Xiantian → Golden Core. Enemies and stakes scale to Earth.
- **Interplanetary travel is locked** until you reach **Nascent Soul** (元婴). This follows wiki and chapter canon: Qi Xiao brought people from Earth to Planet Tianhuang at Nascent Soul; Chen Fan reaches Tianhuang via teleportation at the advanced stage of martial cultivation. Soul Formation cultivators cannot *enter* Earth (arrays), but leaving requires at least Nascent Soul.
- **Realm requirements for leaving Earth** are strict: the **Star Teleportation Platform** at Mount North Qiong only becomes available at Nascent Soul. The transition from Earth to other planets is a **major narrative milestone** with a dedicated message.
- **Beyond Earth**, the world expands in canonical order: **Abandoned Star Region** → **Planet Tianhuang (Heavenly Desolate Star)** → **Little Southern Heavenly Realm** → **Central Galaxy World**. Each layer has higher danger, qi density, and power scale (Tianhuang: Connate/Divine Sea widespread; Little Southern: Soul Formation = Sect Masters; Central Galaxy: Nine Great Immortal Sects).
- **Narrative phases:** Early (urban, sect rivalries) → Mid (national/global, Xiantian–Golden Core) → Late Earth (Nascent Soul, departure possible) → Interplanetary (Tianhuang) → Endgame (Little Southern, Central Galaxy, cosmic-scale threats). Progression is not compressed; advancement from Earth to cosmic-level conflicts requires significant cultivation milestones.

**Novel:** Ten Miles Sword God (十里剑神). Power scaling and realm order follow the wiki and novel; original side content does not contradict canon.

**Timeline alignment:** The game’s narrative phases mirror the novel’s progression: early game (Chuzhou, Jiangbei, urban + hidden sects) echoes Vol 1–3; mid game (national/global, Xiantian–Golden Core) echoes Vol 4–7; leaving Earth at Nascent Soul echoes the Timeline’s “left Earth … Desolate Star Territory” / Tianhuang (Qi Xiao at Nascent Soul; Chen Fan later via Star Gate after Golden Core). Beyond Earth, the cosmological order (Abandoned Star Region → Planet Tianhuang → Little Southern Heavenly Realm → Central Galaxy World) follows the wiki.
